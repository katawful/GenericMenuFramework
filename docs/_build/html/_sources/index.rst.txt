Welcome to GenericMenuFramework
===============================

GenericMenuFramework is a framework plugin for Oblivion designed to make the creation
and management of generic menus in Oblivion easier. For many years, the understanding
of how to make a generic menu has been unknown to the Oblivion community, with only a few
examples out there. With this plugin, making a new menu is the simplest it has ever been.
